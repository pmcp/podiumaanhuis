videoLength: '71 min'
text: "“In my arranging and rearranging of images I’m like a child \[…\]

I’m like a lunatic adorning my hair with dried flowers that are still alive in my dreams.”

Fernando Pessoa, Book of Disquiet, §193

Two centuries ago, in 1817, Wilhelm Müller started sketching his collection of poems in the style of folksongs, striving for a simplicity of form, a singability of meter, deep unconscious ardor, which reverberates for a long time, and naive unaffectedness in the shy articulation of what is most elevated.

The collection Die schöne Müllerin portrays a story reflecting the quest for a future life, in search of love and means of existence, using irony and metaphor as literary tools.

In this production SPECTRA takes Die Schöne Müllerin of Schubert/Müller as a musical-literary roadmap, asking composer Daan Janssens to be the guide towards a contemporary landscape. 

The original musical structure of the composition and the literary topics are preserved as blueprints for an actualization, that carefully removes the patina covering this masterpiece and transposes it into a present day setting. Topics as dreams and disillusions are put into a new perspective using Fernando Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet. Thus a new song cycle emerges, subtly combining Schubert’s original with Janssens’s personal language.With Die Schöne Müllerin as guideline Daan Janssens constructs a series of tableaux for bariton (Thomas E. Bauer) and instrumental ensemble in which the reverberations of the original linger on, reflected in the mirror of today.
