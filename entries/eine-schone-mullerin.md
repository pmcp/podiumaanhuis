  <p>“In my arranging and rearranging of images I’m like a child […]</p><p>I’m like a lunatic adorning my hair with dried flowers that are still alive in my dreams.”</p><p>Fernando Pessoa, Book of Disquiet, §193</p><p>Two centuries ago, in 1817, Wilhelm Müller started sketching his collection of poems in the style of folksongs, striving for a simplicity of form, a singability of meter, deep unconscious ardor, which reverberates for a long time, and naive unaffectedness in the shy articulation of what is most elevated.</p><p>The collection Die schöne Müllerin portrays a story reflecting the quest for a future life, in search of love and means of existence, using irony and metaphor as literary tools.</p><p>In this production SPECTRA takes Die Schöne Müllerin of Schubert/Müller as a musical-literary roadmap, asking composer Daan Janssens to be the guide towards a contemporary landscape. </p><p>The original musical structure of the composition and the literary topics are preserved as blueprints for an actualization, that carefully removes the patina covering this masterpiece and transposes it into a present day setting. Topics as dreams and disillusions are put into a new perspective using Fernando Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet. Thus a new song cycle emerges, subtly combining Schubert’s original with Janssens’s personal language.With Die Schöne Müllerin as guideline Daan Janssens constructs a series of tableaux for bariton (Thomas E. Bauer) and instrumental ensemble in which the reverberations of the original linger on, reflected in the mirror of today.</p><h5>Credits</h5><p>composer: Daan Janssens</p><p>baritone: Thomas E. Bauer</p><p>SPECTRA conducted by Filip Rathé</p><p>Commissioned by SPECTRA, Festival 20/21 and Muziekcentrum De Bijloke.</p><p>Supported by the Ghent School of Arts/Conservatory Research Fund.</p><p>World Creation: 20 October 2018, Leuven (Festival 20/21)</p><p>live-recording by Klara</p><p>musical director: Johan Favoreel</p><p>‍</p><p>Opname door PARCHFILMS</p>
